# Random_image_extension

Just created my first Google Chrome extension and I'm thrilled to learn how it works! It's amazing how extensions can modify and enhance the functionality of the browser. Looking forward to creating more! I would love to share what I learned while making this extension.


- One must know HTML, CSS and JavaScript in order to make a google chrome extension. Manifest.json is the file that makes it extension. 
Manifest.json must include the following :- 
```

{
    "name": "name",
    "description": "here goes your description",
    "manifest_version": 3,
    "version": "1.0.1",
    "action": {
        "default_popup": "popup.html",
        "default_icon": {
            "16": "icon.png",
            "32": "icon.png",
            "48": "icon.png",
            "128": "icon.png"
        }
}
}


  ```

- These are the basic required files to make a google extension.
